Benefits of this solution: <br/>caption will open up in a dedicated screen to allow easy reading. <br/><br/> Bad stuff: <br/>there's no reliable way to detect whether it's overflowing or not via JS (trust me I checked), so it will ALWAYS show the expand button.<br/><br/>
                                    
This can be deployed dynamically (fetching from a JSON file), will implement that soon.

On 25 September 2024, train services on the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) East–West line (EWL) were disrupted when an axle box of a Kawasaki C151 train dislodged, damaging the track and equipment along the stretch between the Clementi and Dover stations. This resulted in the suspension of regular services between the Boon Lay and Queenstown stations, affecting more than 2.6 million commuters.<br/><br/>

Described by experts as a "rare" incident, the damage was reported to be extensive, and services was expected to be restored only some days after.During restoration works by engineers from the Land Transport Authority and SMRT Corporation, shuttle train services were restored for the stretches between the Queenstown and Buona Vista stations, and between the Jurong East and Boon Lay stations. Bus bridging services were provided for the closed segment between the Buona Vista and Jurong East stations. <br/><br/>

Services resumed on 1 October. This was one of the longest train disruptions on the MRT network in Singapore's history, as well as the longest since 2017. Investigations into the incident are ongoing. <br/><br/>
